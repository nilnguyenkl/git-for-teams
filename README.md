# Exercise
### Set up a git project for team
    - Development team: 3+ developers, 1 scrum master
    - Operation team: 2 operation
    - Management team: 1 project manager
### Delivery plan
    - 1 Feature Package/2 weeks
    - 1 Patch Package/4 weeks
    - 1 Production Package/3 months
### How do
    - Describe the work your team does
    - Map your network of repositories
    - Diagram your branching strategy
    - Defend what gets stored in the repo
    - Simulate delivery plan
    - Submit your team result: link of repositories, diagrams, team members
### Required Using
    - cherry-pick
    - rebase
    - merge
    - tag
    - branch
    - pull request
    - code review

# Resolve

## Access control
### Strategy: Shared Maintenance
I choose "Shared Maintenance" because I observe that developers work in a branch of the centralized code repository and only the politics of the project prevent them from committing their work to the main body of work.
## Branching pattern
### Pattern: Schedule Release
I choose "Schedule Release" because I observe that We can change it into a release with a scheduled release cycle. Moreover, It combines human-reviews.
## Diagram branching strategy

### Description
    - Creating a new branch called the "developer" branch to develop features. When we want to add new features, we will create branches with the corresponding feature. 

    - When a feature is completed, the developer will create a pull request for reviewers reviewer. The reviewers will check, approve, and comment on the developer's code. When the code is approved, they have permission to merge into the developer branch. 

    - Next, the releases branch will be created on the developer branch to update version and check errors, then create a pull request and it will be merged into the main branch (it's will be tagged for the new version) and back to develop branch to continue by the project manager if reviewers approve.

    - In case of a version error, We detach it into the hotfix branch to fix the error and merge back the main branch and developer branch to continue to develop another feature (we have to create a pull request and wait for the reviewers' approval before we merge).
